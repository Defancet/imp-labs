## Overview

This laboratory exercise focuses on usage Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to control the brightness of an RGB LED using
the MCU's timer channels. The laboratory exercise demonstrates the application of PWM signals to create varying
brightness levels in a multi-color LED setup.

## Expected Behavior

- The application should smoothly increase the brightness of the RGB LED to its maximum and then decrease to its minimum
  in a continuous cycle.
- Modify the Timer0Init() and main() functions to produce this behavior using PWM signals generated by the timer.

## Implementation Notes

- **Timer Initialization:** Set up the timer to generate PWM signals using the Timer0Init() function.
- **Main Function Loop:** Increment and decrement a 'compare' variable within the main loop, which controls the PWM duty
  cycle corresponding to the LED's brightness.
