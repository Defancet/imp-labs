# Microprocessors and Embedded Systems Labs

In each exercise, a simple task is solved, allowing you to practice one of the key fundamental concepts of programming embedded systems. The work is done directly on hardware (kits with NXP Kinetis microcontrollers with ARM core). The task involves completing code in the C language for a prepared simple application.
