## Labs Overview

This repository contains a series of laboratory exercises designed to introduce various aspects of embedded systems
programming using the MCU platform. The labs cover UART communication, GPIO and interrupts, PWM signal generation, and
ADC sampling.

### 1. UART Communication and Embedded Application

Learn UART communication and programming basics for embedded applications.

### 2. Application of Ports for GPIO and Interrupt Handling

Utilize GPIO ports and configure interrupts for handling button presses.

### 3. Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Laboratory: Controlling RGB LED Brightness

Control the brightness of an RGB LED using PWM generated by the MCU's timer channels.

### 4. Continuous Signal Sampling and Display using ADC Converter

Perform continuous signal sampling using an ADC and display the results on a 4-digit 7-segment LED
display.
